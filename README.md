# IoT-Project-
IoT project with ZigBee, sensors, arduino and GSM --> In this, we present a multi-tiered wireless sensor network system based on ZigBee/IEEE802.15.4 and GSM that has the ability to report to the substation with information on the attributes of an Power outage, including location and possible extent of the outage. The proposed system uses and has ZigBee Pro and GSM module and Arduino Microcontroller at higher level to deliver data and wireless sensor networks at the lowest level over far distances by using a tree topology. Therefore, this system can be installed in remote locations that are difficult to hard wire or have no access to electricity.
